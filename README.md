## Carepath Prediction

Welcome to the analysis of some carepathes dataset. 
In this project, we want to try a DeepLearning Approach in order to predict the next activity of a patient, from a fictive log of patient activity covering the Diagnosis, Treatment, Recovery and End_of_life Care.

5. Install a Neo4j desktop : https://neo4j.com/download/?ref=desktop

6. In the second cell of the notebook, configure your connection to Neo4j server

## [Data Exploration](#data-exploration)

- Source : Anonymized activity of patients 
2 kinds of datasets availables :
	- Dataset_Simple_V0.csv : to check the correctness of the algorithm.
	- DL_Project_DAtaset_Cluster... : Bigger datasets to be tested.

- Structure of the data: 
![Data_Structure](Data_structure.png) 
it's a log file of activity, giving an Id of the patient, a datetime of the activity (Datedebut, Date_fin, and J_Parcours which define the starting date of the carepath),
 Where it has been relealizes (UF) plus some details of the activity.
 Which kind of Care has been given, according to a code of activity.
 Id of a "sejour', which represent a group of care activity given in a same visit at the hospital.
 Id and type of Sequence, which is a group of 'sejour' which took place in a close range of time (less than 3 monthes).

## [Models Analysis](#models-analysis)

- First of all we implement a modelization of the carepath in the Neo4j database and get back node Embeddings in order to create some "sentence of activity" for each patient.
- From this package of "sentences" we create randomly a train and test dataset to be applied on different models.
- Then we make a first approach with a linear model to check if we can predict some behaviour of this log activity.
- Then we apply a logic of text generation on a RNN neural network and try to predict the next activity of a patient.
	- The input vector is a tensor composed of the sequence node + Embeddings (minus the last Sequence node).
	- The output vector is a similar tensor but with the last node and without the first one.
	- I explicitly moved the softmax layer in order to be able to compute the closest predicted Node.

## [Results](#results)

- The Linear approach, regarding to the embedings vectors seems to predict accuratly some activities, but with a high variance. 
- The DeepLearning approach looks like to learn some patterns, but is very sensitive to the data.
	- By using the Dataset_Simple_V0.csv, we can see that the loss converge rapidly to zero, meaning that the network is learning.
	- But by using the bigger Dataset, we can see that the loss oscilate around a mean value, and get sometimes a huge high "peak", meaning that 
	  something is changing in the input data, that can be a problem of inconsistency in the data.
	- We can see also that the number of Neuron of the hidden state is crucial to maintain a stability of the losses:
		- For low range of hidden state (less : than 40 neurons) the loss can decrease or star stable depending of the dataset.
		- For high range of hidden state (more : than 40 neurons) the loss increase rapidly and get infinite values.

## [Conclusion](#Conclusion)

- We need to go more in detail in some aspect :
	- Filtering, and cleaning the input Data.
	- Change the input data to be able to handle with supervised learning.
	- Improve the neural network, for example, we could integrate the emmbedings in a layer inside the neural network, or oppositly change the input vector with a One Hot Encoding vector and add a softmax layer at the end.
	- Test an LSTM network which is less sensitive than RNN on long sentences.
	
- Finally, this very intersting project allows us to understand and work with a neural network. But the data used seems to contain too much complexity to be understand by a simple RNN neural network.
